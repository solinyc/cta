      <h1>
        Affordable Effective Legal Assistance Needed for Victims of Domestic
        Violence
      </h1>

      <p>
        Every year, nearly 10 million men and women are victims of domestic
        violence by an intimate partner in the United States. Rape, physical &
        emotional assault, economic depletion, stalking, homicide; DVs’ reach
        knows no social, religious, racial, or ethnic bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 94 and 99% of domestic violence

        abuse impacted their ability to work; 40% reported their abuser harassed
        them at work via phone and/or in person.

        Statistics show children whose parents are victims of domestic violence
        experience long-lasting emotional and psychological effects, which can
        also harm their current schoolmates, as well as their future
        relationships and families.
        <strong
          >(1 in 15 children are exposed to intimate partner violence each year,
          and 90% of these children are eyewitnesses to this violence often time
          leaving lasting PTSD well into their teens)</strong

          Teen-Dating-Violence Statistics
        </a>
        show nearly 20.9% of female high school students and 13.4% of male high
        school students report being physically or sexually abused by a dating
        partner. Given the prevalence of domestic violence during ages 16-24 in
        dating relationships and a shift in the structure of relationships
        today,
        <strong>
          it is imperative communities work together to ensure victims of domestic
          violence have access to resources and an increase in legal
          protections.

          ><strong>1 in 7 men</strong>
        </a>
        have been severely physically abused (hit with a fist or hard object,
        kicked, slammed against something, choked, burned, etc.) by an intimate
        partner at some point in their lifetime. In my research, I was able to locate more than 1 resource to support female victims. As I was researching online resources for male victims of DV however, it was baffling how long it took to find just <a href="https://www.onslowwc.org/mens-resources-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault"><strong>One.</strong></a> Ironically enough, it comes from the <a href="https://onslowwc.org/">Onslow <strong>Women's </strong>Center</a> located in Jacksonville, NC.
        
      </p>
      
    

      <p>
        Several <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a> and <a href="https://ncadv.org/">NCADV</a> statistics show over 43 million women and over 38
        million men have experienced psychological aggression from an intimate
        partner. That’s 1 in every 4 women and, the previously mentioned, 1 in 7 men! For 15 million of those people (11 million women and 5 million men) the abuse began in their teens. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It is clearer than ever -ALL victims of DV suffer and need support both emotionally and financially. Some of the terrible adverse
        health outcomes associated with DV include cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive, musculoskeletal, and
        nervous system conditions, many of which are chronic. Then there are
        mental disorders that come as well such as posttraumatic stress disorder
        (PTSD).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2018, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379718319044">Lifetime Economic Burden of Intimate Partner Violence Among
        U.S. Adults American Journal of Preventive Medicine</a> shed light on the
        $3.6 trillion dollar lifetime economic cost of medical services, lost
        productivity from paid work, criminal justice and other costs related to
        DV injuries. 
        </p>
    <p>Awareness, support and guidance are the tools needed to support victims. There are however, multiple ways to go about preventing
        DV/IPV (Intimate Partner Violence) like creating protective environments (ie. improving school and
        work climate/ safety), more victim-centered services like first
        responder & civil legal protections, and social emotional learning
        programs for the youth to teach safe and healthy relationship skills.
